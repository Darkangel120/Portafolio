    "about": [
        "Inicio-XAMPP is a visual and modern dashboard to manage local projects when changing the `htdocs` path in XAMPP. It replaces Apache's basic listing with an attractive and functional interface.",
        "The system automatically lists all project folders, showing useful information such as size, update date, and status, and allows direct navigation to projects with start files.",
        "Developed with PHP and JavaScript, it offers a smooth user experience with a dark theme inspired by GitHub, smooth design and animations that adapt to different screen sizes.",
        "Ideal for developers using XAMPP to manage multiple local projects, eliminating the need to remember paths and providing an organized view of all work."
